This is a log of all changes made after meeting on 7/8
Combined all code together

created a SearchCopyFields in bookDao

added getAllBooks function to bookDao; used by Search class

search returns type list<book>
the search class has a new function, displayTitles(list<Book>) which returns a string
the Search class has another new function, displayBooks(list<Book>) which return a string
The Search class has a new function, displayUnloaned(list<Book>) which returns a string
made a new function in Search called getCopyID which returns a String

added setNull function to book; 

made a search_admin.jsp page

Don;t use displayAll anymore; recreate functionality using book, Search.search(book) and Search.displayBooks()

got rid of changeStatus_withcopyid; 
Note for presentation: we are thinking of splitting the process returns function into its own class; however, couldn't do it this time
