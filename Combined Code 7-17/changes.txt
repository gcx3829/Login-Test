added inventoryID to book; added getInventoryID and setInventoryID to book methods
deleted CopyID, and all related methods from Book; replaced all methods with getInventoryID in my code
Created new Search file; created SearchBookDetails, SearchCheckedOut, SearchTitles, SearchUsers subclasses
changed controllers to use new Search functions
Added necessary BookDao functions for search; marked in both files as function that do not need to be changed
added getBooks function which uses InventoryID to return book object
Marked in controller what code needs to be changed


FOR FUTURE:
need to change my bookDao function to use Book Constructor
