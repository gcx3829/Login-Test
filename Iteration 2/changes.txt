This is a log of all changes made after meeting on 7/8
Combined all code together

created a SearchCopyFields in bookDao

added getAllBooks function to bookDao; used by Search class

search returns type list<book>
the search class has a new function, displayTitles(list<Book>) which returns a string (just title fields user should see)
the Search class has another new function, displayBooks(list<Book>) which return a string (all fields in database)
made a new function in Search called getCopyID which returns a String

added setNull function to book; used eerywhere

made a search_admin.jsp page

Don't use displayAll anymore; recreate functionality using book, Search.search(book) and search.displayBooks()

got rid of changeStatus_withcopyid;

made ManageBooks.processReturn(String ISBN, int condition), which is used by ManageController

Completely reformatted the manage class to mirror the loan class
edit function are now in EditBooks class;
delete function are now in DeleteBooks Class; (This is still unused/unimplemented in controller)
processreturn function is now in ProcessReturn class;

in bookDao, deleted getBookDetails, and replaced with getTitleDetails, and getCopyDetails function

Note for presentation: we are thinking of splitting the process returns function into its own package; however, couldn't do it this time
Another Note: haven't implemented system to charge fees
